# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Can't think of what you want to gift this holiday season? Try this Christmas Simulator!

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that will give the user an idea on what to gift someone for christmas and also help them find/purchase the item nearby. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We are planning to use HTML and Python to bring this project to life. We will use HTML to make our webiste and python to direct the html to pick out gifts from the list based on category chosen by the user. Categories will be: Adults, Kids, toddlers, Seniors. The user will first be presented with Get started. Then they will be given a drop down list to pick the category. Based on the category, it will take them to the christmas tree with those gifts. They will be able to click on the gift and it will show them the item and give them an option to find that item nearby. If they then click that option, it will direct them to google without having to type anything and will lookup that item nearby. Let's say that they are not ineterested in what they opened. They can open another gift and keep doing it until they find something they like. There will be six gifts per category. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not Applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Working with [Ria Chittargi, tuo44524@temple.edu, Xinwen Zhang] and [Tirth Patel, tup13859@temple.edu, Bin Li].

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Our outcome will be atleast the user will be able to get a gift for their family member because they ran out of ideas or they are in a hurry due to time conflict, etc. For us programmers, at least publishing the website will be a good outcome, even if somethings don't work as proposed. We atleast learned html and the designing of the website. Little bit of front end experince. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If we figure out a way to make python and html work together, then that will be something huge that we will accomplish because even my TA was suggesting to research about it online due to him not being familiar with combining python and html.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Images, Website, Location, and Choices. Location thing is a must and the best outcome because I never thought I would be able to do something like that, this early in my programming career. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Ria - Pick out gifts, make a list of gits, getting pictures, research what people want based on the categories mentioned in one of the previous answer. 
Tirth and I will design the website, I will also learn a little bit of CSS to help with the project. 
First we will start with getting gifts, images, lists sorted out in python, to get our feet wet. Then start designing the website to then implement python. Then work on how to get user location with the user click, etc. We will definetly need to research how to combine python, html and css. Will also need to research how to make the location element of our project to work.
